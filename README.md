### Summary of Client and Software Requirements
**Client**: The Gaming Room  
**Objective**: To expand their Android game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a web-based, multi-platform application.  
**Key Software Requirements**:
- Support multiple teams and players in a game.
- Ensure unique game and team names.
- Provide a web-based platform accessible on Linux, Mac, Windows, and mobile devices.
- Ensure scalability, security, and efficiency using object-oriented principles and design patterns like singleton and iterator.

### Reflection on Documentation and Process
1. **What you did well**:
   - You thoroughly analyzed client requirements and translated them into technical and design specifications.
   - You incorporated robust design principles, such as object-oriented programming (OOP), ensuring scalability and maintainability.
   - Your evaluation of platform compatibility and recommendations for architecture provided clear, actionable guidance.

2. **Helpful aspects of working through the design document**:
   - The process clarified project constraints and key priorities (e.g., scalability and cross-platform compatibility).
   - Creating the domain model and applying OOP principles made coding more systematic, reducing errors and improving maintainability.

3. **Revision area**:
   - *Evaluation Section*: The analysis of mobile platforms could be expanded to include more technical challenges, such as differences in mobile browsers or screen sizes.
   - **Improvement**: Add specific testing strategies for mobile optimization, including tools like BrowserStack, to ensure cross-platform performance.

4. **Interpreting and implementing user needs**:
   - The design was rooted in the client's goals of scalability, security, and cross-platform usability.
   - User needs drove the inclusion of unique name validation and responsive design, emphasizing seamless gameplay across devices.
   - Considering user needs ensures the software remains relevant, accessible, and user-friendly, ultimately supporting business success.

5. **Approach to software design**:
   - Strategies included analyzing requirements, leveraging design patterns, and focusing on modular OOP principles.
   - Future techniques: Use Agile methodologies for iterative development and user feedback. Apply tools like UML diagrams for precise visualization of complex systems.
